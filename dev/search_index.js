They are inspired by elisp's advice system, namely the most versitile form — :around advice, and Clojure's advisors.\n\nA DataAdvice is esentially a function wrapper, with a priority::Int attribute. The wrapped functions should be of the form:\n\n(post::Function, action::Function, args...; kargs...) ->\n  (post::Function, action::Function, args, kargs)\n\nA three-tuple result with kargs ommited is also accepted, in which case the an empty kargs value will be automatically substituted as the fourth value.\n\n    input=(action args kwargs)\n         ┃                 ┏╸post=identity\n       ╭─╂────advisor #1───╂─╮\n       ╰─╂─────────────────╂─╯\n       ╭─╂────advisor #2───╂─╮\n       ╰─╂─────────────────╂─╯\n       ╭─╂────advisor #3───╂─╮\n       ╰─╂─────────────────╂─╯\n         ┃                 ┃\n         ▼                 ▽\naction(args; kargs) ━━━━▶ post╺━━▶ result\n\nTo specify which transforms a DataAdvice should be applied to, ensure you add the relevant type parameters to your transducing function. In cases where the transducing function is not applicable, the DataAdvice will simply act as the identity function.\n\nAfter all applicable DataAdvices have been applied, action(args...; kargs...) |> post is called to produce the final result.\n\nBy modifying post via rightwards-composition (i.e. post -> post ∘ extra) the transdurers compose quite nicely.\n\n        ╭ advisor #1 ╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌─╮\n        ┆ ╭ advisor #2 ╌╌╌╌╌╮ ┆\n        ┆ ┆                 ┆ ┆\ninput ━━┿━┿━━━▶ function ━━━┿━┿━━▶ result\n        ┆ ╰╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╯ ┆\n        ╰╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╯\n\nWithout a very, very good reason all advisors should behave this way. Otherwise, when post is left-composed (i.e. post -> extra ∘ post), advisors compose like so:\n\n        ╭ advisor #1 ╌╌╌╌╌╌─╮\n        ┆ ╭ advisor #2 ╌╌╌╌╌┼╌╮\n        ┆ ┆                 ┆ ┆\ninput ━━┿━┿━━━▶ function ━━━┿━┿━━▶ result\n        ╰╌┼╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╯ ┆\n          ╰╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╯\n\nConstructors\n\nDataAdvice(priority::Int, f::Function)\nDataAdvice(f::Function) # priority is set to 1\n\nExamples\n\nLogging every time a DataSet is loaded.\n\nloggingadvisor    = DataAdvice(\n    function(post::Function, f::typeof(load), loader::DataLoader, input, outtype)\n        @info \"Loading $(loader.data.name)\"\n        (post, f, (loader, input, outtype))\n    end)\n\nAutomatically committing each file written.\n\nwritecommitadvisor    = DataAdvice(\n    function(post::Function, f::typeof(write), writer::DataWriter{:filesystem}, output, info)\n        function writecommit(result)\n            run(`git add $output`)\n            run(`git commit -m \"update $output\"`)\n            result\n        end\n        (post ∘ writecommit, writefn, (output, info))\n    end)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"advising/#Advisement-points","page":"Data Advice","title":"Advisement points","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"advising/#Parsing-and-serialisation-of-data-sets-and-collections","page":"Data Advice","title":"Parsing and serialisation of data sets and collections","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"advising/","page":"Data Advice","title":"Data Advice","text":"~DataCollection~​s, ~DataSet~​s, and ~AbstractDataTransformer~​s are advised at two stages during parsing:","category":"page"},{"location":"advising/","page":"Data Advice","title":"Data Advice","text":"When calling fromspec on the Dict representation, at the start of","category":"page"},{"location":"advising/","page":"Data Advice","title":"Data Advice","text":"parsing","category":"page"},{"location":"advising/","page":"Data Advice","title":"Data Advice","text":"At the end of the fromspec function, calling identity on the object","category":"page"},{"location":"advising/","page":"Data Advice","title":"Data Advice","text":"Serialisation is performed through the tospec call, which is also advised.","category":"page"},{"location":"advising/","page":"Data Advice","title":"Data Advice","text":"The signatures of the advised function calls are as follows:","category":"page"},{"location":"advising/","page":"Data Advice","title":"Data Advice","text":"fromspec(DataCollection, spec::Dict{String, Any}; path::Union{String, Nothing})::DataCollection\nidentity(collection::DataCollection)::DataCollection\ntospec(collection::DataCollection)::Dict","category":"page"},{"location":"advising/","page":"Data Advice","title":"Data Advice","text":"fromspec(DataSet, collection::DataCollection, name::String, spec::Dict{String, Any})::DataSet\nidentity(dataset::DataSet)::DataSet\ntospec(dataset::DataSet)::Dict","category":"page"},{"location":"advising/","page":"Data Advice","title":"Data Advice","text":"fromspec(ADT::Type{<:AbstractDataTransformer}, dataset::DataSet, spec::Dict{String, Any})::ADT\nidentity(adt::AbstractDataTransformer)::AbstractDataTransformer\ntospec(adt::AbstractDataTransformer)::Dict","category":"page"},{"location":"advising/#Processing-identifiers","page":"Data Advice","title":"Processing identifiers","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"advising/","page":"Data Advice","title":"Data Advice","text":"Both the parsing of an Identifier from a string, and the serialisation of an Identifier to a string are advised.
